      content="Dawn Builders is a large scale survival-adventure multiplayer Minecraft server originally founded in March 2022. Our purpose is to use Minecraft to create in depth stories and experiences for users to enjoy from the work of our team of dedicated writers, designers, artists, and architects. We are currently based in the Americas looking to expand in the future and learn from a wider array of Minecraft oriented workers. Our team looks forward to meeting you when the server officially opens and hopes to expand our skills to creating Minecraft maps, items, and blocks for other server-owners and build a larger community."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
